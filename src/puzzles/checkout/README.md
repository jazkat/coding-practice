Checkout System
===============

Consider a store where each item has a price per unit, and may also have a volume price. For example, apples may be $1.00 each or 4 for $3.00.

Implement a point-of-sale scanning API that accepts an arbitrary ordering of products (similar to what would happen at a checkout line) and then returns the correct total price for an entire shopping cart based on the per unit prices or the volume prices as applicable.

Here are the products listed by code and the prices to use (there is no sales tax):
Product Code | Price
--------------------
A            | $2.00 each or 4 for $7.00
B            | $12.00
C            | $1.25 or $6 for a six pack
D            | $0.15
